Project Requirements Deliverable: Description

The language that we will be using is Java. The 4 rooms will consist of Poker, Blackjack, Slots, and Roulette. The player will have to make good gambling decisions to take down the house. Individual challenges will depend on the game the player is currently playing. The player must have to defeat all four of the rooms in order to win the game. If the player does not pass a room, they will get sent to the first room that they started at. You only have one try per room. 

Blackjack will be in the first room. Given a starting hand, the player will have to decide whether to hit or stand. The goal is to beat the dealer by having a hand as close to 21 as possible without going over. You win this game by gaining a profit of at least $50. If you don’t win in the first five rounds, you lose and go back to the hub room. After that, they will have the chance to play again or switch games.

Poker will be the second room. They will be given a hand with two cards at first, and the player will have the option to call, raise, and fold. You can only raise in increments of $10, $25, $50.  This is called the pre-flop betting round. Then another card will get added to the flop round and this round will be called the Turn betting round. The player will have another chance to call, raise and fold. Then you will see all 5 cards on the table and this is called the River betting round. You will have one more option to call, raise, and fold. Last but not least, you will have a Showdown with the ‘Computer Player’ it will show your hand and your rank, and the computer's rank and the computers rank. 

Slots will be the third room. In this room, the player can choose between two machines, 'Rails to Riches' or 'Luck of the Irish,' and decide how many times to spin, with options for 1 to 10 spins. The player can also set their bet denomination between $1 and $10. The goal is to hit the jackpot by matching the machine's odds, with winnings based on the selected bet and jackpot multiplier.

Roulette will be the fourth room. The player will have 5 rounds to attempt to win $200 more than their current balance. The player will first choose how much they want to bet, which will divide into how many choices they have to pick on what they desire to bet on. The player can pick an individual number, two different sets of numbers, even or odd numbers, and the color red or black. A random number will be chosen and the player will be notified if what they bet on was selected or not. If the player wins $200 or more, they win, otherwise, they lose.
